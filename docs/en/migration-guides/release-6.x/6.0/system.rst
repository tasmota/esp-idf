Xtensa
------

The Xtensa special register header files have been updated to use a new naming convention. The old ``specreg.h`` header files are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
The register names have been updated to use the ``XT_REG_`` prefix. Please use the new ``xt_specreg.h`` file instead.
